# Flood-It!

Flood-It! is a game where you have to "flood" the game board in a certain amount of steps.

## How to Play

To play, simply click the color you wish to select. Your selected color is the one in the top left of the board. The color you choose will "flood" the slots around it that are the same color. Keep selecting a color until the entire board has been flooded with the same color.
